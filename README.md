ajax
====

Basic AJAX library that kind of simulates the way jQuery does AJAX requests.

---

### Why another AJAX library?
We do not want to require useless code we don't use (like jQuery). This library is also a little bit more basic in terms of possibilities. It just does what it's supposed to do, and does it lightweight.


### API
Coming SOON.

### Example
```js
new Ajax();
```
